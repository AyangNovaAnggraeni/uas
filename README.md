# Final Project – Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

This repository contains the final project for the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** class.  
It is a simple and responsive website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **PHP**, with a focus on **user experience, interface design**, and **form usability**.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The website is designed as a small-scale prototype that demonstrates HCI principles, including:
- Clear layout and navigation
- Accessible typography and color scheme
- Interactive elements with feedback
- Responsive form design

Although it is a front-end-focused project, it includes basic form handling using **PHP**, and utilizes a third-party tool (**Formspree**) for form submissions without requiring a database.
So the form submitted will be sent to owner's email (in this case my personal email)
